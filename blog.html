        <p class="About-blogPost">In the 21st Century, cinema has continued its reign as one of the most influential mediums for sending a message to society. Movies that can succeed in such ordeals are the perfect mix of dialogue, imagery, music, and emotion. They can effectively communicate important truths about the world by bringing light to stories and voices that had not been previously heard. Cinema is a game changer in cross-cultural communication and self-expression.

        Firstly, films play a significant role in literacy as they engage audiences in multiple forms of communication and storytelling, starting off with the most obvious way: dialogue. Dialogue can be so meaningful. While dialogue is crucial for character development and plot progression, it is also significant in theme exploration and emotional impact. Well-crafted dialogue can evoke emotions and make the viewer reflect on the complex ideas, societal issues, and philosophical concepts explored in the movie. Think back to your favorite movies and their famous lines that have gone down in history: </p>

  <p>Each of these lines evokes some emotion and thought about people, society, and the role that diverse groups play. Films also use language through narration, title sequences, subtitles, soundtracks, and more. For example, in multilingual movies, such as the South Korean dark comedy thriller, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6751668/" target="_blank">"Parasite"</a> (2019), subtitles help provide translations. The use of subtitles allows international audiences to comprehend the film's nuanced dialogue and social commentary, which fosters cross-cultural literacy. Overall, this diverse range of language elements enables multimodal literacy as viewers are engaged with media across diverse formats, thus contributing to their overall literacy proficiency.</p> <br> 

<p>In this way, language is a tool used in movies to convey meaning and leave a lasting impact on viewers and society. According to the essay "Language" by Amitava Kumar, "...[Language] transformed, knowingly or unknowingly, into a weapon of protest" (284). This is how the elements of language in films allow for social protest, as filmmakers can make a statement about their view of the world. Movies can tell stories about people's lives that have never been publicly known. They can show the world the problems in people's lives and explain why humanity must fix them. For example, the movie, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5580266/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_the%2520hate%2520u" target="_blank">"The Hate U Give,"</a> depicts the struggles associated with police brutality. Starr, the main character, is a voice for change, as her dialogue and emotion help us see the pain of being discriminated against due to one's skin color. Stories like this reveal society's hidden truths, such as different power struggles, no matter how disturbing they may be. Thus, movies must exist- without them, societal change and improvement might never happen.</p><br>

<p>Without movies, the danger of a single story comes into play. Mediums like literature can indeed prevent the threat. Still, movies are more effective since they can reach a mass audience immediately when released in theaters and streaming platforms. Movies can tell the world about diverse identities and voices that have never been known. In the Ted Talk, <a href="https://youtu.be/D9Ihs241zeg?si=TL26el7Y2-bOqZyX" target="_blank">"The Danger of a Single Story,"</a> Adichie says, "...stories too are defined by the principle of nkali: How they are told, who tells them, when they're told, how many stories are told, are really dependent on power. Power is the ability not just to tell the story of another person, but to make it the definitive story of that person. The Palestinian poet Mourid Barghouti writes that if you want to dispossess a people, the simplest way to do it is to tell their story…" (00:09:58 - 00:10:27). Movies provide filmmakers with the power to tell their own stories or stories that matter to them. The more films made about diverse groups of people, the more understandable this group will be in the eyes of the public. As more and more films are released, a wide variety of stories are being told, ensuring that no one is unheard. I want to add, though, that movies, like other forms of media, often portray stereotypes, which can harm the reputation of certain groups. However, due to the mass release of new movies, this can be avoided as specific groups of people can be shown in a new light that accurately tells the world about their identity.</p><br> 

<p>I also add that movies are equipped with audio and visual aids, a feature that mediums like literature cannot compete with. Soundtracks and imagery in a movie can make all the difference in emotional impact. Overall, movies are an essential medium in storytelling. It is with movies that everyone alike can leave their mark on the world!
